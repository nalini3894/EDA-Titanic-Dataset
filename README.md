# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

This is my **first project on GitHub**, focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the structure of the dataset, identify missing values, analyze data distributions, and explore relationships between different features using visualizations.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Dataset inspection and summary statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Data visualization using histograms, count plots, and correlation heatmaps

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project helped me build a strong foundation in data analytics, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis techniques.

## 📁 Files Included
- `EDA_Titanic_Dataset.ipynb`
- `titanic_dataset.csv`
